Directory structure
-------------------

* /vox -- the original models in .vox format
* /collada -- optimized polys for use in game frameworks like Unity
* /screenshots -- screenshots

Instructions for loading in Unity
---------------------------------
When loading the collada models into Unity, the textures will look blurry and 
stretched until you adjust the .png import settings:

  * TextureType: advanced
  * Non Power of 2: None
  * Generate Mip Maps: unchecked
  * Filter mode: point

For maximum prettiness, this author recommends turning on ambient occlusion and anti-aliasing.  

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q: What software did you use to make these?
A: Magicavoxel and VoxelShop for exporting the collada files

Q: Are these characters rigged?
A: Nope. I recommend making them waddle or sticking a popsicle stick up their butt and dragging them around.  It's cartoony, you'll get away with it.
