Mini Mike's Metro Minis
=======================

A city-themed collection of voxel models you can remix or use outright in your 
own works.

  /vox -- the original models in .vox format
  /collada -- optimized polys for use in game frameworks like Unity
  /previews -- screenshots

Instructions for loading in Unity
---------------------------------
When loading the collada models into Unity, the textures will look blurry and 
stretched until you adjust the .png import settings:

  TextureType: advanced
  Non Power of 2: None
  Generate Mip Maps: unchecked
  Filter mode: point

These models are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,

appropriate credit, a link to the license and indicate if changes were made.

For attribution, all you need to do is: in the credits of your project, say 
something like Additional Artwork by Mike Judge, and if you're feeling kind, 
please send me a link to your project on twitter so I can brag about my art 
being in it!

Enjoy!
