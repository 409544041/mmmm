Directory structure
-------------------

* /vox -- the original models in .vox format
* /collada -- optimized polys for use in game frameworks like Unity
* /screenshots -- screenshots

Instructions for loading in Unity
---------------------------------
When loading .collada models into Unity, the textures will look blurry and 
stretched until you tweak the .png import settings:

  * TextureType: advanced
  * Non Power of 2: None
  * Generate Mip Maps: unchecked
  * Filter mode: point

For maximum prettiness, this author recommends turning on ambient occlusion.  If you can afford it, anti-aliasing and depth of field are lovely too.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q: What software did you use to make these?

A: Magicavoxel and VoxelShop for exporting the collada files


Q: Are these characters rigged?

A: Nope. I don't really understand how to fit that into my process. I recommend making them waddle or sticking a popsicle stick up their butt and dragging them around.
