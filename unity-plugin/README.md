Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q: What software did you use to make these? How can I tweak them?

A: The author used MagicaVoxel for creating the initial models, and VoxelShop 
for exporting optimized collada polys for inclusion in Unity. The original .vox 
files are available at http://github.com/mikelovesrobots/mmmm


Q: Are the characters rigged?

A: No. The author recommends hopping them around with iTween or sticking a stick
up their butt and dragging them around.
